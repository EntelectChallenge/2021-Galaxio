# Entelect Challenge 2021 Galaxio Visualiser

This visualiser is aimed at helping you, the player, to make sense of what is going on during your games and process log files.

## Usage

For all use cases, you will need two files ready:

- The game state log
- The game complete log

These files should be situated on the same path on your OS.
The game complete log should be named as `gameState_gameComplete.json`, where `gameState` is the name of your game state log you want to visualise.
If the gameComplete log cannot be auto-detected, the visualiser will not run.

### Windows

1. Run the Galaxio.exe file
    - If you get a pop up from windows defender, choose `More Info` and then `Run Anyway`
2. Use the "LOAD" button to select your `game state` log file
3. Click "BEGIN"
4. If the log is big, give it a moment to load. 
5. Once you can see the start of the game in front of you, use the space bar to start the match.

Make sure you review the controls under the "CONTROL" button.
